Creating a full Software Design Document (SDD) with high-level and low-level class diagrams would be an extensive process that usually involves the use of diagramming tools and software like UML tools, and goes beyond the scope of a text-based response. However, I can provide an outline for an SDD and describe what would typically be included in each section, including descriptions of the high-level and low-level components.

# Software Design Document for Autonomous Data Collection Agent (ADCA)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document provides a comprehensive architectural overview of the Autonomous Data Collection Agent (ADCA), presenting a collection of structural elements and their interactions with each other to fulfill the requirement of transferring data from the organization's network to a private network through a data diode.

### 1.2 Scope
The ADCA is a Python-based application designed to interface with various application endpoints to collect data, handle authentication, apply necessary filters, and facilitate the secure transfer of data to a location where the data diode can process it further.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
- ADCA - Autonomous Data Collection Agent
- API - Application Programming Interface
- UML - Unified Modeling Language
- SDD - Software Design Document
- CoE - Center of Excellence

### 1.4 References
List of the references to external documents, standards, or other SDDs.

### 1.5 Overview
Further document organization and references to the following sections.

- Data Collection Module
- Scheduler Service
- Authentication Handler
- Encryption Service
- Database Manager

## 3. Component Design

### 3.1 `autonomousagent.py`
Creating a textual representation of a UML Class Diagram can be a bit abstract, but I'll outline how the `autonomousagent.py` module's classes and their operations might be structured. Normally, this would be represented visually using UML diagramming software.

**UML Class Diagram for `autonomousagent.py`**

1. **Class: CurrentEndpoint**
   - **Attributes:**
     - `id: int`
     - `app_id: str`
     - `name: str`
     - `url_endpoint: str`
     - `method: enum (GET | POST)`
     - `payload: dict`
     - `filters: list`
     - `page_size: int`
     - `last_sync: datetime`
     - `process_status: enum (0 | 1 | 2)`
     - `failed_count: int`
     - `failed_time: timestamp`
     - `status: enum (0 | 1)`
   - **Operations:**
     - `validate()`
     - `build_request()`
     - `send_request()`
     - `handle_response()`
     - `update_sync_times()`
     - `log_failure()`
     - `is_active(): bool`

2. **Class: CurrentApplication**
   - **Attributes:**
     - `id: int`
     - `name: str`
     - `short_name: str`
     - `host: str`
     - `url_scheme: str`
     - `auth_type: str`
     - `auth_data: dict`
     - `dump_path: str`
     - `sync_frequency: cron`
     - `last_sync: datetime`
     - `next_sync: datetime`
     - `default_payload: dict`
     - `default_filters: list`
     - `default_page_size: int`
     - `process_status: enum (0 | 1 | 2)`
     - `status: int`
   - **Operations:**
     - `authenticate()`
     - `schedule_sync()`
     - `sync_now()`
     - `register_endpoint(endpoint: CurrentEndpoint)`
     - `remove_endpoint(endpoint_id: int)`
     - `update_last_sync()`
     - `is_sync_due(): bool`

**Relationships:**
- **CurrentApplication** `1` ---- `*` **CurrentEndpoint**
  - One `CurrentApplication` can have multiple `CurrentEndpoints`. This indicates a one-to-many relationship between applications and endpoints.

**Notes on Operations:**
- **validate()** might check if the endpoint's attributes are correct.
- **build_request()** constructs the HTTP request that will be sent.
- **send_request()** might be the operation that actually sends the request to the endpoint's URL.
- **handle_response()** could parse the response and perform any necessary data manipulation or logging.
- **update_sync_times()** would likely update the `last_sync` attribute and potentially the `next_sync` if applicable.
- **log_failure()** might increment `failed_count` and set `failed_time`.
- **is_active()** would return a boolean indicating the endpoint's active status based on the `status` attribute.
- **authenticate()** manages the authentication process for accessing the application's data.
- **schedule_sync()** sets up the timing for data synchronization operations based on `sync_frequency`.
- **sync_now()** forces a synchronization event outside of the regular schedule.
- **register_endpoint()** and **remove_endpoint()** would add or remove `CurrentEndpoint` instances from the `CurrentApplication`.
- **update_last_sync()** updates the synchronization timestamps after a sync operation.
- **is_sync_due()** checks if the current time meets or exceeds the `next_sync` time.

In a visual UML diagram, each class would be represented by a rectangle divided into sections for the class name, attributes, and operations. The relationships would be shown using lines connecting the classes, with symbols indicating the cardinality (one-to-many, one-to-one, etc.).

You would use a UML tool to draw this diagram, and the output would be a graphical representation that visually communicates the structure and design of the `autonomousagent.py` module.

Creating the actual diagrams and filling in the details of each section would typically be done by the system architect and design team, using a combination of UML diagramming tools and detailed knowledge of the application's requirements and existing infrastructure.

# Autonomous Data Collection Agent Documentation

## Introduction

The Autonomous Data Collection Agent is a sophisticated Python-based application specifically architected to automate the process of collecting data from a variety of applications via their API endpoints. The agent is equipped with dynamic request building capabilities, advanced scheduling, and secure authentication handling, including KeyCloak integration for heightened security.

## Application Overview

### Core Functionalities

- **Dynamic Request Building**: Constructs and sends HTTP requests to API endpoints, capable of specifying filters, attributes, sorting, and pagination.
  
- **Flexible Scheduling**: Integrates a scheduler service that operates in the background to execute API calls based on a predefined frequency.

- **Advanced Authentication**: Handles different authentication methods dynamically, ensuring secure API interactions.

- **Configurable Endpoints**: Allows per-endpoint customization, enabling unique data retrieval requirements per application.

### Component Documentation

#### Autonomous Data Collector Agent Docs (`autonomousagent.py`)

- **Database Management**: Manages a centralized database for tracking applications and their respective API endpoints.
  
- **Endpoint Structure**: Defines an `Endpoint` class with detailed attributes for data retrieval control.

- **Application Structure**: Defines an `Application` class to encapsulate application-related information and synchronization parameters.

- **Operations**: Provides initialization, validation, and CRUD operations for endpoints and applications.

#### Database Module (`database.py`)

- **Initialization**: Sets up paths for JSON-based databases.
  
- **Database Interaction**: Facilitates CRUD operations, retrieval, initialization, and database purging.

- **CLI Usage**: Includes examples and utilities for interacting with the database via a command-line interface.

#### File Encryption Module (`fileencryption.py`)

- **File Security**: Implements file encryption and decryption functionalities to ensure data security during storage.

#### Autonomous Data Collector CLI (`cli.py`)

- **User Interaction**: Provides a command-line interface for interacting with the Autonomous Data Collection Agent.

- **Commands**: Outlines CLI commands for managing threading, encryption, and data management tasks.

- **Usage Instructions**: Offers a detailed guide on how to use the CLI commands.

### Scheduler Service (`scheduler.py`)

- **Windows Service**: Operates as a Windows service, automating data collection tasks according to a schedule.
  
- **Concurrent Execution**: Supports threading for simultaneous data processing.

- **Authentication Management**: Handles various authentication methods, including Keycloak integration.

- **Error Handling**: Implements robust error logging and exception management systems.

## Detailed Features

### Dynamic Data Collection

The application dynamically builds requests for each endpoint, allowing users to define specific parameters such as filters, attributes, order, pagination, and more. This ensures a high level of flexibility and customization for data collection tasks.

### Scheduling and Frequency Control

The built-in scheduler service manages the timing of data collection, executing API calls as configured by the user. This frequency is defined using cron expressions, providing precise control over the synchronization tasks.

### Authentication Handling

The agent is capable of dynamically adapting to various authentication mechanisms. This includes integration with KeyCloak, which offers a secure, token-based authentication process.

### Secure Data Handling

With an integrated encryption module, the agent can secure data both at rest and in transit. This includes full file encryption capabilities, ensuring that sensitive data remains protected.

### CLI Management

Through a comprehensive set of CLI commands, users can manage the agent's operations, including threading, encryption settings, and data endpoint management. This CLI tool enhances the ease of use and accessibility of the application for system administrators.

## Usage Scenarios

The Autonomous Data Collection Agent is suitable for various scenarios, including:

- **Automated Data Retrieval**: Ideal for businesses that require regular updates from multiple applications or services.
  
- **Secure Data Sync**: A fit for scenarios where data security and integrity are paramount, such as handling sensitive or personal information.

- **System Integration**: Can be integrated into larger systems or workflows to provide timely data updates as a backend service.

## Conclusion

The Autonomous Data Collection Agent offers a robust, secure, and flexible solution for automating API data retrieval tasks. With its advanced scheduling, dynamic request handling, and secure authentication, it stands as a valuable tool for organizations looking to streamline their data collection processes.

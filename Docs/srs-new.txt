## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This SRS document outlines the specifications for the Autonomous Data Collector Agent (ADCA), a tool designed to autonomously collect data from various endpoints. It provides a comprehensive description of the system's features, capabilities, and constraints.

### 1.2 Document Conventions
This document follows the IEEE SRS format and uses the following conventions:
- **Bold** - Glossary terms or headings
- *Italic* - Emphasis or document references

### 1.3 Intended Audience and Document Overview
This document is intended for stakeholders, developers, and users involved with the ADCA. It is structured to provide a high-level overview followed by detailed system requirements.

### 1.4 Project Scope
The ADCA is designed to be a scalable and secure tool for collecting, encrypting, and storing data from designated endpoints for analysis.

### 1.5 References
- IEEE. IEEE Std 830-1998 IEEE Recommended Practice for Software Requirements Specifications. IEEE Computer Society, 1998.
- Python Software Foundation. Python Language Reference, version 3.x.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
The ADCA is a standalone system with the capability to integrate with various APIs and databases for the purpose of collecting data without manual intervention.

### 2.2 Product Features
- Scheduled data collection
- Support for multiple data endpoints
- Secure storage with optional encryption
- User authentication
- Extensible architecture

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
- **Administrators**: Manage configurations and monitor the system.
- **End Users**: Utilize the data collected for analysis and decision-making.

### 2.4 Operating Environment
- The ADCA will operate on Windows and Linux environments with Python 3.x installed.
- Requires network access to the endpoints.

### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
- The system must be implemented in Python.
- Secure storage mechanisms must be used for sensitive data.

### 2.6 User Documentation
- Installation Guide
- User Manual
- API Documentation

### 2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies
- Python 3.x is pre-installed on the target systems.
- The system has uninterrupted network access.

## 3. System Features and Requirements

### 3.1 Functional Requirements
- **FR1**: The system SHALL collect data as per the defined schedule.
- **FR2**: The system SHALL authenticate users before allowing configuration changes.

### 3.2 System Features

- **SF2**: User Authentication Module

### 3.3 Performance Requirements
- **PR1**: The system MUST process data collection jobs within 2 minutes of the scheduled time.

### 3.4 Security Requirements
- **SR1**: Data in transit MUST be encrypted using TLS.
- **SR2**: User passwords MUST be stored in a hashed and salted format.

### 3.5 Software Quality Attributes
- **Reliability**: The system SHOULD have an uptime of 99%.
- **Maintainability**: The system SHOULD be designed for easy maintenance and updates.

### 3.6 Business Rules
- **BR1**: Data collection timings SHALL NOT be configurable to frequencies higher than once per minute.

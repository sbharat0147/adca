# Operational Requirements Document

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the operational requirements for the Autonomous Data Collection Agent, a Python-based application designed to collect data from various applications via API endpoints. It aims to define the necessary operational environment, configurations, and protocols required to deploy and maintain the application effectively.

## 2. System Overview
The Autonomous Data Collection Agent automates the retrieval of data by dynamically building and sending requests to API endpoints with customizable filters, attributes, order, and pagination. It integrates a scheduler service for automated operations and provides robust authentication, including KeyCloak integration for secure access.

## 3. Operational Requirements

### 3.1. Environment Setup

#### 3.1.1. Hardware Requirements
- Processor: Minimum dual-core, recommended quad-core or higher
- Memory: Minimum 4GB RAM, recommended 8GB or higher
- Storage: Minimum 20GB of free disk space for logs, databases, and backups

#### 3.1.2. Software Requirements
- Operating System: Windows Server 2012 or later, Linux distributions (Ubuntu 18.04 LTS or later)
- Python Environment: Python 3.7 or higher with PIP for package management
- Database: JSON-based or compatible database software
- Security: KeyCloak server for authentication if using KeyCloak integration

### 3.2. Dependencies
- Python libraries as listed in `requirements.txt` (e.g., `requests`, `pycron`, `cryptography`)
- Win32serviceutil for Windows service management (if deployed on a Windows OS)
- Cron scheduler system (for UNIX-based systems)

### 3.3. Network Requirements
- Stable internet connectivity with outbound access to all target application endpoints
- Properly configured network security (firewalls, etc.) to allow API traffic

### 3.4. Access and Authentication
- Credentials for KeyCloak or other authentication mechanisms
- Authorization to access target application APIs

### 3.5. Configuration
- `config.ini` file with settings for database paths, logging, service intervals, and encryption keys
- Environmental variables for secure credential storage

### 3.6. Deployment
- Automated deployment scripts or manual setup instructions
- A rollback strategy for deployment failures

### 3.7. Data Security
- File encryption mechanisms in place
- Compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)

### 3.8. Monitoring and Logging
- A logging system to capture info, warnings, errors, and debug-level messages
- Monitoring tools for real-time system health checks and performance monitoring

### 3.9. Maintenance
- Regular backups of databases and configuration files
- Scheduled downtime for updates and maintenance tasks
- Up-to-date documentation for system operations and troubleshooting

### 3.10. Support and Troubleshooting
- Technical support protocols
- Incident response plan for system failures
- Contact information for technical support team

### 3.11. User Management
- CLI documentation for end-user operations
- User authentication and access control for CLI and service interfaces

### 3.12. Service Level Agreements (SLAs)
- Defined SLAs for uptime and performance
- Escalation paths for SLA breaches

## 4. Operational Protocols

### 4.1. Startup and Shutdown Procedures
- Steps for safe start-up and shutdown of the Autonomous Data Collection Agent service
- Emergency shutdown procedures

### 4.2. Data Collection Cycles
- Configuration of data collection frequencies
- Handling of missed cycles or errors during data collection

### 4.3. System Updates and Upgrades
- Procedures for applying updates or upgrades to the system
- Validation tests to confirm system integrity post-update

### 4.4. Incident Management
- Steps to identify, report, and respond to incidents
- Post-incident review and preventive measures for future occurrences

### 4.5. Training Requirements
- Required training modules for operators
- Documentation access and knowledge base for self-help

## 5. Conclusion
The Autonomous Data Collection Agent requires a well-defined operational environment, clear protocols, and dedicated support to function optimally. Adherence to these operational requirements will ensure reliable, secure, and efficient data collection activities.

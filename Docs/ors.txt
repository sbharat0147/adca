# Problem Statement for Autonomous Data Collection Agent (ADCA)

## Background

The AI Center of Excellence (AI CoE) at our organization operates within a stringent security architecture where data must flow from the organizational network to an isolated, private network. This flow is controlled by a data diode, ensuring a one-way transfer to maintain security by preventing any possible backflow of information. As the demands for data-driven insights and real-time analytics intensify, the need for a reliable, automated data collection and transfer mechanism that is compatible with the data diode's operational framework has become critical.

## Problem

The current data collection and transfer processes are manual, inefficient, and cannot guarantee the consistency or security required for the sensitive nature of operations. The manual system presents multiple challenges:

1. **One-Way Transfer Compliance**: Ensuring data flows strictly from the organizational network to the private network in compliance with the data diode's security protocols.

2. **Automated Collection Inefficiency**: The lack of an automated process to collect and place data into the diode’s designated transfer folder leads to delays and increased labor.

3. **Data Security and Integrity**: Manual data handling raises significant concerns over the security and integrity of the data during the collection and pre-transfer stages.

4. **System Scalability**: The increasing number and complexity of data sources overwhelm the manual processes, leading to bottlenecks and potential data loss.

5. **Resource Allocation**: Manpower is inappropriately allocated to manual data collection and preparation tasks, which are not strategically advantageous.

6. **Operational Visibility**: The absence of a centralized system to manage and monitor data flows results in limited visibility and control over the data collection and transfer processes.

7. **Compliance and Audit Trails**: Meeting compliance standards is cumbersome without automated logs, potentially exposing the organization to compliance risks.

## Requirement

To mitigate these issues, the AI CoE necessitates an autonomous software solution—Autonomous Data Collection Agent (ADCA)—tailored to integrate with the data diode architecture, with the following essential capabilities:

1. **Data Diode Integration**: Ability to automatically collect data and place it into a specific folder from which the data diode will securely push data to the isolated network.

2. **Automated and Scheduled Collections**: Perform data collection tasks at predefined intervals, reducing delays and eliminating the need for manual intervention.

3. **Secure Handling and Transfer**: Incorporate stringent security measures to maintain data confidentiality and integrity up to the point of transfer through the data diode.

4. **Adaptive Request Construction**: Dynamically construct API requests with the capability to specify filters, attributes, and pagination for different endpoints.

5. **High Scalability**: Efficiently scale to manage the increased volume and frequency of data collection from a growing number of data sources.

6. **Centralized Management Interface**: Offer a unified dashboard for configuring, controlling, and overseeing all aspects of the data collection and preparation for diode transfer.

7. **Compliance and Auditing**: Maintain detailed logs of all operations, supporting stringent regulatory compliance and facilitating effective auditing.

The development of the ADCA is aimed at resolving the current operational challenges and meeting the requirement for a secure, robust, and efficient mechanism to facilitate data flow compatible with the data diode's one-way transfer protocol for the organization's AI and analytics initiatives.

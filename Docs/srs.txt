# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document captures the complete software requirements for the Autonomous Data Collection Agent (ADCA), which automates data collection from various applications through API endpoints.

### 1.2 Document Conventions
This document follows the IEEE SRS format and will use the following conventions:
- **MUST** for requirements that are essential for the system.
- **SHOULD** for requirements that are important but not necessary for core functionality.
- **MAY** for requirements that are optional.

### 1.3 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions
This document is intended for the development team, project managers, and the end-user representatives who are providing the requirements.

### 1.4 Product Scope
The ADCA aims to provide a flexible, secure, and efficient means of collecting and managing data from different APIs with dynamic request building capabilities.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
The ADCA is a standalone product intended to be integrated into the userâ€™s IT environment to facilitate automated data collection.

### 2.2 Product Features
- Dynamic API request generation with customizable parameters.
- Integrated scheduler for automated data collection.
- Authentication handling, including OAuth2 and KeyCloak integration.
- CLI for user interaction and management tasks.

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
- System Administrators who will manage and configure the system.
- End Users who will interact with the system via CLI for operational tasks.
- Developers who may extend or integrate the ADCA with other systems.

### 2.4 Operating Environment
- The ADCA MUST be able to run on Windows and Unix-based systems.
- The ADCA SHOULD be containerizable for deployment using Docker.

### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
- The application MUST be developed in Python 3.7 or above.
- Data MUST be stored in a JSON-based database for flexibility and ease of use.

### 2.6 User Documentation
- A user guide MUST be provided for system administrators and end users.
- API documentation MUST be provided for developers.

### 2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies
- The system's operation depends on network accessibility to various API endpoints.

## 3. System Features

### 3.1 Data Collection Automation
- The system MUST support scheduling for data collection tasks.
- The system SHOULD allow for frequency configurations for each task.

### 3.2 Dynamic Request Handling
- The system MUST be able to dynamically construct API requests.
- The system SHOULD offer filtering and pagination capabilities.

### 3.3 Authentication and Security
- The system MUST support multiple authentication methods.
- The system SHOULD encrypt sensitive data at rest.

### 3.4 Error Handling and Logging
- The system MUST log errors and provide debug information.
- The system SHOULD offer configurable logging levels.

## 4. External Interface Requirements

### 4.1 User Interfaces
- The system MUST offer a CLI for interaction.

### 4.2 Hardware Interfaces
- There are no specific hardware interface requirements for the system.

### 4.3 Software Interfaces
- The system MUST interface with KeyCloak for authentication.
- The system SHOULD be able to export data to common formats like CSV or JSON.

### 4.4 Communications Interfaces
- The system MUST use HTTP/HTTPS protocols for API interactions.

## 5. Other Non-Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Performance Requirements
- The system SHOULD be optimized for minimal memory and CPU usage.

### 5.2 Safety Requirements
- The system MUST not store plain-text credentials.

### 5.3 Security Requirements
- The system MUST implement industry-standard security practices.

### 5.4 Software Quality Attributes
- The system MUST be maintainable, with a clear code structure and documentation.
- The system SHOULD ensure reliability and offer an uptime of 99%.

## 6. Other Requirements

### 6.1 Database Requirements
- The system MUST maintain a JSON-based database structure.

### 6.2 Operational Requirements
- The system SHOULD provide an easy backup and restore mechanism for the database.

### 6.3 Legal Requirements
- The system MUST comply with relevant data protection laws such as GDPR.

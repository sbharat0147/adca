   - Describe error handling mechanisms and logging strategies.

## 9. Testing
   - Outline the testing strategies, test cases, and testing environments.

## 10. Appendices
   - Include any additional information such as configuration files, code snippets, or detailed database schemas.

Each section should contain detailed information based on the snippets you've provided, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the system. As an example, let's elaborate on Section 4.1 for the `autonomousagent.py` component.

## 4. Detailed System Design

### 4.1 `autonomousagent.py`
#### 4.1.1 Module Description
The `autonomousagent.py` module is the core of the Autonomous Data Collection Agent. It orchestrates the management of databases holding application and endpoint data. Its primary responsibility is to ensure that data is collected from various sources with the necessary attributes and filters as defined by the user.

#### 4.1.2 Data Structures and Algorithms
`CurrentEndpoint` and `CurrentApplication` are the primary data structures used by this module. These structures include fields for identifiers, application details, sync configurations, and status indicators. 

- `CurrentEndpoint` Structure:
  ```python
  endpoint: {
      id: int, app_id: str, name: str, url_endpoint: str,
      method:

 str, headers: dict, params: dict, body: dict, status: int
  }
  ```
- `CurrentApplication` Structure:
  ```python
  application: {
      id: int, name: str, short_name: str, authentication_details: dict, status: int
  }
  ```

Algorithms used include a dynamic request builder that constructs API requests based on endpoint configurations and an authentication handler that refreshes tokens as needed.

#### 4.1.3 Process Flows and Logic
The flowchart below depicts the process for an endpoint data collection operation:

```plaintext
Start -> Retrieve Endpoint Config -> Build Request -> Authenticate -> Send Request -> Receive Response -> Store Data -> End
```

The agent handles CRUD operations by invoking the respective functions defined in the `database.py` module. It employs a modular approach, allowing for easy maintenance and scalability.

       Relationships:
   
       Endpoint to Application:
           An Endpoint is associated with an Application. This is represented by the "app_id" attribute in the Endpoint entity, which is a foreign key referencing the "id" attribute in the Application entity. This relationship signifies that each Endpoint is connected to an Application.
   
       Cardinality:
   
       Endpoint to Application:
           Many Endpoints can be associated with one Application, indicating a "Many-to-One" relationship.
   
   This ERD provides a visual representation of the relationships between the "endpoint" and "application" objects. You can use a diagramming tool or software like Lucidchart, draw.io, or a database design tool to create a more detailed and organized version of this diagram.
